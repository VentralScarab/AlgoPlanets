# AlgoPlanets

Python script to randomly generate AlgoPlanets with different attributes. 
Each attribute has a different probability of getting picked. Attributes are partly based on astronomy and partly not. Based on the randomly drawn attributes, the planet is categorized as Common, Rare, Super Rare, Ultra Rare und Secret Rare. A detailed list of all attributes and there possibilities can be seen on our website: www.algoplanets.com or on https://github.com/VentralScarab/AlgoPlanets/tree/main/Rarity%2C%20Chances%20%26%20Attributes. 
Every planet will be a unique NFT (actually 1/1) and will have a resolution of 80x80. 

Every AlgoPlanet will be iven a unique code in the process, in order to not generate the same planet twice. After the AlgoPlanet is generated a second script will stack the different layers of images on top of each other to form the planet.

*Not the "prettiest" script but it will do the job
