# AlgoPlanets

Python script to randomly generate AlgoPlanets with different attributes. 
Each attribute has a different probability of getting picked. Also every planet will be a unique NFT (actually 1/1).

The generated Planet will then be saved in a txt.file. Another python script will generate the .png using pre-designed PNGs, from which the "first" script selects.

*Not the prettiest script but it will do the job :)
